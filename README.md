# alu-secret

This project focuses on teaching programming logic through **JavaScript**.

It utilizes **JavaScript** elements in combination with **CSS** to manipulate buttons on static web pages.

### Key Concepts and Features Implemented:

- Validate information using conditionals.
- Interrupt the execution of a function using `return`.
- Get the number of elements in an array using the `length` property.
- Check if an element exists in an array using the `includes` function.
- Declare an array variable to represent a list.
- Add an element to an array using the `push()` method.

The app provides a **secret code** that users can solve with logical reasoning. It was developed as an educational tool, helping users engage with programming concepts in a fun way.
